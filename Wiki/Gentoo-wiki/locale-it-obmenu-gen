A different locales can be configured via:
Code: [Select]
~HOME/.config/obmenu-generator/config.pl
change:
Code: [Select]
"name_keys"           => ["Name"],
to your lang, for example pl_PL:
Code: [Select]
"name_keys"           => ['Name[pl]', 'GenericName[pl]', 'Name'],

Missing lang is about the category names and custom entries only.
