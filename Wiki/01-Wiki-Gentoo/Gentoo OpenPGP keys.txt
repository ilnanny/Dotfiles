The Gentoo release media OpenPGP keys are now available as a binary keyring. These can be installed via the app-crypt/gentoo-keys package:
root #emerge --ask app-crypt/gentoo-keys

This will install the keyring to the /var/lib/gentoo/gkeys/keyrings/gentoo/release location.

# Disable synchronization by clearing the values or setting auto-sync = no
# Do not set value of the variables in this configuration file using quotes ('' or "")!
sync-type = webrsync
sync-uri =
auto-sync = yes
sync-webrsync-verify-signature = true

Make sure that app-crypt/gnupg package is installed:
root #emerge --ask app-crypt/gnupg

Use gpg to verify that the keys in the keyring are the correct keys:
root #gpg --homedir /var/lib/gentoo/gkeys/keyrings/gentoo/release --with-fingerprint --list-keys --keyid-format 0xlong

Verify the fingerprints of the key(s) against those listed on the official Gentoo release engineering project page.
Important
If any of the keys installed from app-crypt/gentoo-keys should expire, run gkeys from app-crypt/gkeys to refresh them from the key server:
root #emerge --ask app-crypt/gkeys
root #gkeys refresh-key -C gentoo

Repeat the following command for each key you wish to trust. (Substitute the keyid '0x...' for the desired key you wish to trust.)
root #gpg --homedir /var/lib/gentoo/gkeys/keyrings/gentoo/release --edit-key 0xDB6B8C1F96D8BF6D trust

Should a GPG command-line menu appear, fully trust the key and quit the program by entering the following:
gpg>4
gpg>quit

The system is now set-up to sync using only OpenPGP/gpg verified snapshots.
Several command options are available to perform the sync.
Note
Only one of the following commands is needed to sync. See the Portage's sync wiki article for more details.
root #emerge --sync
root #emaint sync -a
root #emaint sync --repo gentoo
root #emerge-webrsync
Verify distfiles

To re-verify the integrity and (potentially) re-download previously removed/corrupted distfiles for all currently installed packages, run:
root #emerge --ask --fetchonly --emptytree @world
