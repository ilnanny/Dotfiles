Dell 1320c color laser printer Linux install
============================================
Updated: 8/3/2008

Note: this install was done on a Fedora 9 Linux installation.

Follow printer initial hardware instructions to setup printer hardware and insert paper in printer tray.
Connect printer to network with dhcp server (cable router, etc...).
Power on printer.
When printer is ready, press and hold printer "Continue" button to print settings pages to get printers DHCP assigned IP address.

To configure the printer, connect to and login to it via:
 http://x.x.x.x/ where x.x.x.x is your printer's IP address.
  Default printer username: admin
  Default printer password: (blank/none)
 Change the printer to use a static IP address instead of DHCP address.

The Dell 1320c seems to work with the Fuji Xerox DocuPrint C525A printer Linux driver:
