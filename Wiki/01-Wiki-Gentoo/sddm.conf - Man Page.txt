/usr/lib/sddm/sddm.conf.d

Description

This file configures various parameters of the sddm display manager sddm(1). If this file is not available, default values are used.
Options

[General] section:

HaltCommand=

    Halt command. Default value is "/usr/bin/systemctl poweroff".
RebootCommand=

    Reboot command. Default value is "/usr/bin/systemctl reboot".
Numlock=

    Change numlock state when sddm-greeter starts. Valid values are on, off or none. If property is set to none, numlock won't be changed. Default value is "none".
InputMethod=

    Set the Qt input method for the greeter. Tablet users with Qt Virtual Keyboard installed can set this to "qtvirtualkeyboard" for the on-screen keyboard. Other known values are "ibus" for the Intelligent Input Bus, or "compose" for dead keys support. Leave this empty if unsure.
Namespaces=

    Comma-separated list of paths bound to Linux namespaces to enter with setns() before starting the user session.  For example, to enter network namespace mynet created with ip netns add mynet, the value might be /run/netns/mynet.  Default value is empty.  (The value is ignored if the operating system is not Linux.)

[Theme] section:

ThemeDir=

    Path of the directory containing theme files. Default value is "/usr/share/sddm/themes".

    Name of the current theme. By default this setting is empty, meaning the embedded theme will be used.

CursorTheme=

    Name of the cursor theme to be set before starting the display server.
Font=

    Name of the font to be set before starting the display server. Please note that the theme can still override this option.

    Path to the user session log file, relative to the home directory. Default value is ".local/share/sddm/wayland-session.log".
EnableHiDPI=

    Enables Qt's automatic HiDPI scaling. Can be either "true" or "false". Default value is "false".
