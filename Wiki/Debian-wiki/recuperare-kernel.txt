Open Terminal
Mount the debian partition: sudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt
Mount some special partitions:
sudo mount --bind /dev /mnt/dev
sudo mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc
sudo mount --bind /sys /mnt/sys
(optional) When you are connected to a network, use the DNS servers from your Live environment (otherwise host names can possibly not be resolved):
cp /etc/resolv.conf /mnt/etc/resolv.conf
Chroot into the /mnt: sudo chroot /mnt
Install the Linux kernel: apt-get install linux-image-generic (no sudo required as you are root after a chroot)
After a successful installation of the kernel, get out the chroot and unmount some filesystems:
exit
sudo umount /mnt/sys
sudo umount /mnt/proc
sudo umount /mnt/dev
sudo umount /mnt
Reboot and remove CD or USB: sudo reboot
