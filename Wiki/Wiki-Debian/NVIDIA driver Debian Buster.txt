During the installation you may be asked the following set of questions:
The CC version check failed:

The kernel was built with gcc version 8.2.0 (Debian 8.2.0-14), but the current compiler version is cc (Debian 8.3.0-2) 8.3.0.

This may lead to subtle problems; if you are not certain whether the mismatched compiler will be compatible with your kernel, you may wish to abort installation, set the CC environment variable to the name of the compiler used to compile your kernel, and restart installation.

                                                     Ignore CC version check                                         Abort installation
