# Try to use GNOME's gdm session manager.  This comes first because if
# gdm is on the machine then the user probably installed it and wants
# to use it by default:

# Someone thought that gdm looked prettier in /usr/sbin,
# so look there, too:

elif [ -x /usr/bin/kdm ]; then

# If all you have is XDM, I guess it will have to do:
#if [ -x /usr/bin/xdm ]; then

#elif [ -x /usr/X11R6/bin/xdm ]; then
